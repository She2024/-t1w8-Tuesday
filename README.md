# Object Oriented Programming (contd..)
- 4 Pillars of OOP

## Encapsulation
- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside.
- Achieved using private attributes and providing public methods to access and update them.
- Syntax: __varname


## Abstraction
- Concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary feature of an object
- Acheived by using Abstract class and method. 

### Abstraction Class and Method
-


## Inheritance
- Mechanism of creating a new class based on an exisiting class, by inheriting properties (attributes and /or mehtods)
- Parent class: The calss from where the feature are inherited from. 
- Child class: The class that inherits the features. 
- Benifits classes are created easily and easy maintenance. 


## Polymorphism
- Ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- Allows methods to do different things based in the object it is acting on.
